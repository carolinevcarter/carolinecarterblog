A few weeks ago, through my endless network of Paris links, I stumbled upon a heavenly website called “Et si on se promenait à Paris“, translation: And what if we walked around Paris? Browsing through this captivating blog, it soon becomes very clear that the editor and photographer, Mademoiselle Audrey F, knows that there’s taking a walk in Paris and then there’s taking a walk in Paris.

 Have you ever wondered if the Paris you remember from childhood in Disney’s Aristocats still exists? Et si on se promenait a Paris will take you to the most magical parts of this town that you would never imagine are sitting right in the middle of a capital city, waiting to be discovered. You just have to be good at snooping around! Pictures ensued ;)w
