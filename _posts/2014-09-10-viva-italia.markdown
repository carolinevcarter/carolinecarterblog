What does vacation mean to you? My version of vacation is anything active. Perhaps sailing, tennis, hiking, biking. I love vacations where I feel like I’ve discovered something and where I get the chance to eat as local as possible.

During my amazing trip to Carrara, I was lucky enough to explore the famous marble quarries and try my luck at an electric bike ride with my sister and my mom. I’ve never been on an electric bike before let alone seen one, so I had no idea what to expect.

*How to ride a bike like an Italian may come in handy!
